## MetroBot [Arduino Light Following Robot]  
#####[You can watch Real Demo Video in YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4NeVFnRNUQ)
###Introduction
MetroBot Light following robot is designed to find out the brightest source of light around its surrounding and move towards that light source.
The robot uses Light De-pendent Resistors (LDR) to find out the light source.
It works on the principle that the resistance of a LDR which changes on the amount of light that falls on it. 
In general, the resistance of LDR goes minimum when the maximum amount of light falls on it and maximum when no light falls on it.

###Working Principle
Two LDRs attached to the left and right side of the robot differentiate the dark and bright source of the light. If the difference between the intensity of light is large enough which falls on the LDRs then the robot makes it turns towards the bright light source (High Intensity of Light).
